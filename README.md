# Rithmatist-Game
A game based on Brandon Sanderson's "The Rithmatist"
Or at least that's what we hope for some day.

## Executables
Executables contains all the playable versions of the game. This is the folder that matters for playtesters!
Currently there is only the C# version (Godot Mono) because I (Cryptic) can't figure out how to get Cope's C++ version to run...
I'll explain all the different versions once there are more

## Rithmatics
Rithmatics contains the current version of the game that we are working on, openable in Godot 3.3. If you want to join the dev team, this is the important one!

## Old Work
This contains old builds of the game and miscellaneous assets. We'll probably delete this in time, but for the meantime while we work on the current version we may pull things from older builds.
